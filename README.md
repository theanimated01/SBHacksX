## Purrformance: The Desktop Cat Companion

🚀 Inspiration

Okay, picture this: you're trying to study or work, but those pesky distractions (hello, YouTube and endless online shopping) keep luring you away. Enter Purrformance, our digital cat buddy that's here to keep you on track. Inspired by our own battles with focus and a love for cute cats, we thought, why not create a fun yet helpful desktop pal? So we did, and it's pawsome!

🐱 What It Does

Purrformance isn't your average desktop pet. It's got this smart AI brain that keeps an eye on what websites you're visiting. Say you're researching the French Revolution but get sidetracked by cat videos on YouTube. Performance jumps into action! The tab magically closes, and the cat starts chasing your cursor around the screen, playfully scolding you for straying off task. It's like having a furry focus coach!

😅 Challenges We Ran Into

- Creating a Comparison AI: This was the big brain stuff – making an AI that understands what's relevant to your study topic and what's not. It's like teaching a cat to sniff out distractions.
- Animating a 3D Cat: We wanted Purrformance to be more than a flat cartoon. Getting those animations and bring life to it took a lot of mental peace.
- Interacting with Desktop Elements: Syncing up Purrformance's actions with your computer habits – not a walk in the park, but hey, we did it.
- Keeping It Snappy: Balancing cool features with not slowing down your computer was key. No one likes a laggy desktop pet.

🌟 What's Next for Purrformance

- More Customization: Who says you can only have a cat? Why not a dog, a hamster, or even a dragon? (Okay, maybe not a dragon...)
- Even Smarter AI: We're talking a cat that not only closes tabs but maybe also suggests resources or gives you quick quizzes on what you're studying.
- Assistant Features: Integrating to-do lists, reminders, and maybe syncing with your calendar. Purrformance could be your personal assistant (in cat form).
